In this section, we see how to handle error or exception in solidity. Let's have our code example first then we have food for thought,create a new file name SimpleException.sol and have following code:

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ExampleException {
    mapping(address => uint) public balanceReceived;

    function receiveMoney() public payable {
        balanceReceived[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdrawMoney(address payable _to, uint _amount) public {
        if (_amount <= balanceReceived[msg.sender]) {
            balanceReceived[msg.sender] -= _amount;
            _to.transfer(_amount);
        }
    }
}

```
