In this section, we see how to handle error or exception in solidity. Let's have our code example first then we have food for thought,create a new file name SimpleException.sol and have following code:

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ExampleException {
    mapping(address => uint) public balanceReceived;

    function receiveMoney() public payable {
        balanceReceived[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdrawMoney(address payable _to, uint _amount) public {
        if (_amount <= balanceReceived[msg.sender]) {
            balanceReceived[msg.sender] -= _amount;
            _to.transfer(_amount);
        }
    }
}

```
Let's save 1 ether to the contract and then try to get back 1.5 ether:
```js
const contract = await ethers.getContractAt("SimpleException", "0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3")
await contract.receiveMoney({value: ethers.parseEther("1.0")})
await contract.withdrawMoney("0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266", ethers.parseEther("1.5"))
```
When you run the commands above, they just run nomally and you can't notice you have made a mistake, that is you want to take back more amount than you saved. If we make a
simple change to the code as following:

```sol
function withdrawMoney(address payable _to, uint _amount) public {
        require(_amount <= balanceReceived[msg.sender], "Not enought funds, aborting");
        balanceReceived[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        _to.transfer(_amount);
    }
```
We are using require directive to replace the if keyword, deploy the contract and run the commands again, then you wil get following result:
```js
> await contract.withdrawMoney("0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266", ethers.parseEther("1.5"))
ProviderError: Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with reason string 'Not enought funds, aborting'

```
You can see there is an error occured and the transaction is reverted, and it shows the string we set into the require to indicate what kind of error happended. Let's see 
another directive that is very useful in preventing error, assert is used to check some kind of situation should never happen, if it dose happend, the smart contract will 
crash, it just like blue screen of windows system when unrecoverable error happend in the kernel, let's see the code example:

```sol
 function receiveMoney() public payable {
        //not allow to receive more than 100 wei
        assert(msg.value <= 100);
        balanceReceived[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
```
Deploy the contract and let's see what will happend when we send more than 100 wei to the function:
```js
> const contract = await ethers.getContractAt("SimpleException", "0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3")
undefined
 await contract.receiveMoney({value:101})
Uncaught:
ProviderError: Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with panic code 0x1 (Assertion error)
```
As you can see, when assert fail, it will cause the VM to panic. Of course we want to have a change to handle the error instead of letting the error to ruin everything,
and solidity provide try catch, and it works differently compare with other programming language:

```sol
contract SimpleException {
....
string public errorReason;

    function errorHandling() public {
        WillFail will = new WillFail();
        //can only use function from other contract
        try will.failingFunction() {
            //code here if it works
        } catch Error(string memory reason) {
            errorReason = reason;
        }
    }

uint public panicCode;

    function panicHandling() public {
        WillFail will = new WillFail();
        try will.assertFunction() {
            //if it works
        } catch Panic(uint code) {
            panicCode = code;
        }
    }
}

contract WillFail {
    function failingFunction() public pure {
        require(false, "calling failing function");
    }

    function assertFunction() public pure {
        assert(false);
    }
}
```

Compile and deploy the contract and let's call the errorHandling function to check the result:
```js
> const contract4 = await ethers.getContractAt("SimpleException", "0xDc64a140Aa3E981100a9becA4E685f962f0cF6C9")
undefined
> await contract4.errorHandling()
> await contract4.errorReason()
'calling failing function'
> await contract4.panicHandling()
> await contract4.panicCode()
1n
```
As we can see, the code in the catch Error block is runned.
