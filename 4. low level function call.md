In this section, we will see how we can use low level call to execute methods from smart contract, It looks like hacking at first time, but it is quite useful in some situation. In previous sections, we have seen how to 
call a payable function by using ethers.js, but we haven't seen how to call payable function by solidity, now let's see how to make it, we still using code from previous section:
```sol
contract SimpleException {
    mapping(address => uint) public balanceReceived;

    function receiveMoney() public payable {
        balanceReceived[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdrawMoney(address payable _to, uint _amount) public {
        // require(
        //     _amount <= balanceReceived[msg.sender],
        //     "Not enough funds, aborting"
        // );
        assert(_amount <= balanceReceived[msg.sender]);
        balanceReceived[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        _to.transfer(_amount);
    }

    string public errorReason;

    function errorHandling() public {
        WillFail will = new WillFail();
        //any function after try need to be an external function
        //the function should come from other contract instead of function from current contract
        try will.failingFunction() {
            //code here if it works
        } catch Error(string memory reason) {
            errorReason = reason;
        }
    }

    uint public panicCode;

    function panicHandling() public {
        WillFail will = new WillFail();
        //any function after try need to be an external function
        //the function should come from other contract instead of function from current contract
        try will.assertFunction() {
            //code here if it works
        } catch Panic(uint code) {
            panicCode = code;
        }
    }
}


```
We have a payable function with name receiveMoney, how can we call this function in a smart contract with money sending to this function, following is an exmaple:

```sol
contract CallPayableFunction {
    receive() external payable {}

    function callReceiveMoney(address _contract) public {
        SimpleException instance = SimpleException(_contract);
        instance.receiveMoney{value: 10, gas: 100000}();
    }
}
```

We can see the syntax here, if we are calling a payable function, then we need to send 10 wei to the given payable function, then we need to use {value:10} following the name of that function, the field of gas is 
optional, Since we have two contracts in the same sol file, and we need to deploy both of them, therefore we need to change the deploy script like following:
```js
async function main() {
    const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners()
    const dataTypeContractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("SimpleException")
    const contract = await dataTypeContractFactory.deploy()
    await contract.waitForDeployment()

    console.log("SimpleException address: ", contract.target)
    console.log("Deployer address: ", deployer.address)

    const callPaybleFunction = await ethers.getContractFactory("CallPayableFunction")
    const contract1 = await callPaybleFunction.deploy()
    contract1.waitForDeployment();
    console.log("CallPayableFunction address: ", contract1.target)
}
```
Run the deploy script, we will get the following result:
```js
SimpleException address:  0xCf7Ed3AccA5a467e9e704C703E8D87F634fB0Fc9
Deployer address:  0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
CallPayableFunction address:  0xDc64a140Aa3E981100a9becA4E685f962f0cF6C9
```
As we can see, we know the address of both contract, now the first thing we need to do is send some money to the CallPayableFunction contract, we have already know how to do that:
```js
> const [sender] = await ethers.getSigners()
undefined
> const response = await sender.sendTransaction({to: "0xDc64a140Aa3E981100a9becA4E685f962f0cF6C9", value:ethers.parseEther("1.5")})
undefined
> await response.wait()
```
Now the CallPayableFunction contract has money to send, then we can call its callReceiveMoney to send money to SimpleException contract:
```sol
> const callPayable = await ethers.getContractAt("CallPayableFunction", "0xDc64a140Aa3E981100a9becA4E685f962f0cF6C9")
undefined
> await callPayable.callReceiveMoney("0xCf7Ed3AccA5a467e9e704C703E8D87F634fB0Fc9")
> const simpleException = await ethers.getContractAt("SimpleException", "0xCf7Ed3AccA5a467e9e704C703E8D87F634fB0Fc9")
> await simpleException.balanceReceived("0xDc64a140Aa3E981100a9becA4E685f962f0cF6C9")
10n
```
As we can see that, the SimpleException contract receive 10 wei from sender with address of 0xDc64a140Aa3E981100a9becA4E685f962f0cF6C9 and this is exactly the address of CallPaybableFunction contract.
