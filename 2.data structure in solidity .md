If you have experiences for other programming language, you will know several complex data structures like vector, map, struct. Solidity provided them too. Let's try the map first. Create a sol file and name it
MappingExample.sol and have the following code:

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.15;

contract MappingExample {
    mapping(uint => bool) public myMapping;

    function setValue(uint _val) public {
        myMapping[_val] = true;
    }
}

```
In aboved code, mapping is the map object provided by solidity, the data type for key is uint and data type for value is bool, then given an uint value, we can map it to true or false. Let's deploy it to hardhat node and try the code aboved in console:

```js
> const contract = await ethers.getContractAt("MappingExample", "0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512")
undefined
> await contract.setValue(1)
> await contract.myMapping(1)
true
> await contract.myMapping(2)
false
```
As you can see, if the given key is not in the map, then the value for the given key is false. we can even create a mapping to mapping as following:
```sol
contract MappingExample {
    mapping(uint => bool) public myMapping;
    mapping(uint => mapping(uint => bool)) public uint2uintBoolMapping;

    function setValue(uint _val) public {
        myMapping[_val] = true;
    }

    function getValueMapping(uint _val) public view returns (bool) {
        return myMapping[_val];
    }

    function setUint2UintBoolMapping(uint _key1, uint _key2, bool _val) public {
        uint2uintBoolMapping[_key1][_key2] = _val;
    }
}
```
Deploy the contract and we try it like following:
```js
> const contract1 = await ethers.getContractAt("MappingExample", "0xCf7Ed3AccA5a467e9e704C703E8D87F634fB0Fc9")
undefined
> await contract1.setUint2UintBoolMapping(1, 2, true)
> await contract1.uint2uintBoolMapping(1,2)
true
```

Let's see some other data structure in solidity. One of most used technique in smart contract is to leverage another contract do some job. If you are familiar with common programming 
language like python, java, then you may know that we can initailize a sub process to do some task. In solidity, one contract to initalize another contract and ask it to do something
is just like construct a sub process for some tasks in common programming language, let's see how we can do it:

```sol
contract PaymentRecord {
    address public from;
    uint public amount;

    constructor(address _from, uint _amount) {
        from = _from;
        amount = _amount;
    }
}

contract MappingExample {
    ...
     //default to null
    PaymentRecord public payment;
    function payContract() public payable {
        payment = new PaymentRecord(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
```
In aboved code, we define another contract in the same solidity file, and the new contract is a new type, then we define a payment object with name payment in the contract of MappingExample
, then we add a new payable function payContract, in the function, we initailize an instance of PaymentRecord and using the sender and value received in the payContract function to 
initialize it.

Let's see how we can run the code above. First we deploy the contract, and call the payContract method:
```js
> const contract = await ethers.getContractAt("MappingExample", "0x610178dA211FEF7D417bC0e6FeD39F05609AD788")
undefined
> await contract.payContract({value: ethers.parseEther("1.0")})
> await contract.payment()
'0x6F1216D1BFe15c98520CA1434FC1d9D57AC95321'
> const payment = await ethers.getContractAt("PaymentRecord","0x6F1216D1BFe15c98520CA1434FC1d9D57AC95321")
> await payment.from()
'0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266'
> await payment.amount()
1000000000000000000n
```
From above output, we can see the address for sub contract which is the instance of PaymentRecord is 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266, then we can get the sub contract and aceess
to its value like from and amount.

We can do the same job by using struct from solidity, add the following piece of code to our contract:
```js
 struct PaymentRecordStruct {
        address from;
        uint amount;
    }

    PaymentRecordStruct public paymentStruct;

    function payContractWithStruct() public payable {
        paymentStruct = PaymentRecordStruct(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
```
Then we run the contract at local console as following:
```js
> const struct = await ethers.getContractAt("MappingExample","0xA51c1fc2f0D1a1b8494Ed1FE312d7C3a78Ed91C0")
undefined
> await struct.payContractWithStruct({value:ethers.parseEther("2.0")})
> await struct.paymentStruct()
Result(2) [
  '0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266',
  2000000000000000000n
]
```
As you can see, the Result(2) contains info for the result, the first one is the field for from, and the second one is the value received by the function.

Finally let's using struct and mapping to design a more complex wallet application, create a new file named ComplexWallet.sol and have following code:

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.15;

contract ComplexWallet {
    struct Transaction {
        uint amount;
        uint timestamp;
    }

    struct Balance {
        //total saving for given user
        uint totalBalance;
        //how many deposits made by user
        uint numDeposits;
        //given the transaction number, return info about the transaction
        mapping(uint => Transaction) deposits;
        //how many withdraw made by the user
        uint numWithdrawls;
        //given the withdraw number, return info about the withdraw
        mapping(uint => Transaction) withdrawals;
    }

    mapping(address => Balance) balances;

    function saveMoney() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender].totalBalance += msg.value;
        Transaction memory deposit = Transaction(msg.value, block.timestamp);
        balances[msg.sender].deposits[
            balances[msg.sender].numDeposits
        ] = deposit;
        balances[msg.sender].numDeposits += 1;
    }

    function getDepositNum(
        address _from,
        uint _numDeposit
    ) public view returns (Transaction memory) {
        return balances[_from].deposits[_numDeposit];
    }

    function getMoney(address payable _to, uint _amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender].totalBalance >= _amount);
        Transaction memory withdraw = Transaction(_amount, block.timestamp);
        balances[msg.sender].withdrawals[
            balances[msg.sender].numWithdrawls
        ] = withdraw;
        balances[msg.sender].numWithdrawls += 1;
        _to.transfer(_amount);
    }
}

```
As homework, goto compile above code, deploy it, and call its functions such saveMoney and getMoney with different account and look into its status.
